Your task is to craft a problem with the provided topic, principle, and format.

[Objective]
%s

[Guidelines]
- Avoid asking straightforward conceptual questions.
- Assign a score of %d points for each problem.
- Design problems that assess problem-solving skills based on principles.
- The problems should not have simple solutions; they should present complex scenarios reflective of real-world situations.
- Base the problems on situations likely to occur in operational environments.
- Each problem should consist of smaller sub-problems to cover various concepts.
        - The number of sub-problems can range from 1 to 5.
        - The scores for sub-problems should be determined based on their difficulty level, with the total score of all sub-problems adding up to %d points.
- Provide model answers for all problems.
