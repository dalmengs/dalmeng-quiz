Please assess and assign scores according to the following criteria and format:

- If the answer thoroughly addresses what the problem asks, award full marks.
- No deductions for missing information not explicitly requested by the problem.
- Grammar errors or language deficiencies should not result in score deductions.
- Deductions are only applicable if the answer fails to address the core elements of the problem or if the answer is incorrect.
- Extra points may be given if a response provides valuable insights unintentionally.
- Scores can be in decimal form, such as 1.5 points or 2.4 points.
- Use JSON format for assessment, following this template:
